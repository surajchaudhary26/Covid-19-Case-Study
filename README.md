Forecasting a Pandemic: A COVID-19 Data Analysis:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project reports an exploratory data analysis (EDA) followed by the creation of a predictive model for worldwide COVID-19 confirmed cases. The main objective was not simply to create a model, but to learn the modeling process of real-world data and to compare the appropriateness of various modeling methods.



Raw Data to Key Insights
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our methodology took a systematic, three-step journey, progressing from initial exploration through modeling and, ultimately, critical assessment of our findings.

--------------------------Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis-------------------------------------

First and foremost, i needed to fully grasp and clean our dataset before any modeling could commence.

Data Cleaning:----------
i found and managed a number of data quality problems. There was a high rate of missing values for the Province/State column, which was dropped to minimize the dataset.

Error Detection: -------
On producing a statistical summary with .describe(), i found an outlier: infeasible negative values for the Active cases column.

Data Correction: -------
I extracted and eliminated these 18 incorrect rows to maintain the integrity of our dataset for modeling purposes.

This first EDA was an important step that was able to stop my model from learning from faulty or missing information.

-------------------------------Step 2: Creating a Baseline Model--------------------------------

With a sanitized dataset, i then set out to construct my initial predictive model. i intentionally chose to begin with the simplest adequate tool for the task:

Linear Regression:--------

The idea was to see if a simple, linear model could capture the trend of a complicated phenomenon such as a pandemic. To help the model, i undertook simple feature engineering:

Feature Generation:------
We generated a ['days_since_start']  column, which mapped the Date data to a plain integer
(0, 1, 2, .). This gave our linear model an easy numerical feature to learn from.

The model was trained on the first 80% of daily case data and kept the last 20% aside for testing.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



-----------------------Step 3: The Outcome and the Critical Awareness---------------------------


I tested our model by graphing its predictions against the data. The outcome was obvious and informative.

my model generated a straight-line prediction that did not reflect the obvious exponential curve of the data. This "failure" was actually the single most significant achievement of the project.

It made an absolute, evidence-based conclusion clear: a simple linear model is not strong enough to effectively model complex, non-linear, real-world phenomena.
